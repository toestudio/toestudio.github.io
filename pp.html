        deleted, object how we use or share your data, and restrict how we use or
        share your data. You also have the right to withdraw consent where you

    <h4>
        Opt-out of targeted advertising
    </h4>
    <p>
        To show you personalized advertisements in our apps we use third-party
        advertising networks and their partners, including those that need your
        consent and listed in ‘APPENDIX A - Advertising networks and their
        partners’ below, to deliver advertisements that are tailored to you based
        on a determination of your characteristics or interests. To do so they use
        personal and non-personal information such as advertising identifiers,
        such as the Android advertising ID and/or Apple's ID for advertising
        (IDFA), and/or other tracking technologies to enable and optimize this
        advertising procedure.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can opt-out from personalized advertisement experience, at any time by
        checking the Privacy Setting tab in any of our apps or under the privacy
        settings of your iOS or Android device.
    </p>
    <h4>For <b>iOS Devices</b>:</h4>
    <ul style="list-style: decimal;">

    <p>
        When you choose to opt-out, advertising networks will consider this choice
        as a withdrawal of consent to personalized advertisement experience and
        they will show contextual advertisements and not personalized
        advertisements based on your interests. Note: Irrespective of your choice
        and/or your device settings, you will continue to see non-customized
        advertising (e.g. “contextual” advertising) and you may continue to
        receive personalized ads from our third-party ad networks that obtain your
        consent on other apps and/or websites. For more information go to
